# molecule-ansible-poetry
Example project showing Ansible collections, Molecule delegated tests and Poetry as dependency management


## What it's about

After some time of absence I wanted to have a brief look into Ansible again: I had a deep look into it but didn't had the time to look into Collections, Ansible 2.10+ and the new Molecule with only Delegated drivers. Also I heard [that Poetry for dependency management is maybe slightly better then my beloved Pipenv](https://plainenglish.io/blog/poetry-a-better-version-of-python-pipenv) and [that it's kind of a successor to it](https://www.warp.dev/blog/prose-about-poetry):

> In 2022, with the standardization of the pyproject.toml manifest, poetry stands out as the most robust and easy-to-use package manager, even for a newcomer to the python universe. In all aspects, it is better than pipenv with a developer experience that I find more complete and enjoyable (see [this post](https://dev.to/farcellier/i-migrate-to-poetry-in-2023-am-i-right--115))

And [it's supported by Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/poetry/). So let's give these tools a short look.

Since I'm currently in the process of switching my go-to environment to Linux / Manjaro, I will also add the needed commands here.


## Install Python, pip, pipx and Poetry

First we need to be sure to have a current version of Python installed. On a Mac a great idea is to use homebrew (`brew install python`), on Manjaro Linux it's already present:

```
$ python --version
Python 3.11.5
```

On a Mac `pip` should be installed via the homebrew package also, on Manjaro I needed to leverage `pamac` (which should apply to other Linux OSses also, using a different package manager):

```
pamac install python-pip
```

Also I wanted to have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed. The [docs help us with the installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs#installation). There is a recommended installation script for Poetry, since there seem to be drawbacks using homebrew or other package managers like Manjaro's pamac: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73365831/4964553 But there's help! [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is also fully supported by Poetry and acts like pip  while still isolating them in virtual environments. The [installation of pipx works like this](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#install-pipx):

```
# MacOS
brew install pipx

# Manjaro Linux
pamac install python-pipx
```

Also run `pipx ensurepath`. Something like this should appear:

```
$ pipx ensurepath
/home/jonashackt/.local/bin is already in PATH.

‚ö†Ô∏è  All pipx binary directories have been added to PATH. If you are sure you want to proceed, try again with the '--force' flag.

Otherwise pipx is ready to go! ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
```

Now can finally [install Poetry via pipx](https://python-poetry.org/docs#installing-with-pipx) via `pipx install poetry`:

```
$ pipx install poetry                                                                                 ÓÇ≤ ‚úî 
  installed package poetry 1.6.1, installed using Python 3.11.5
  These apps are now globally available
    - poetry
done! ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
```

Now upgrading Poetry is as simple as `pipx upgrade poetry`.

Also tab completion could be added to your terminal: https://python-poetry.org/docs#enable-tab-completion-for-bash-fish-or-zsh



# Create a Ansible Collection, Role and Playbook via Poetry and Molecule

## Initialize Poetry: create a pyproject.toml

Using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) is straight forward. For example there's `poetry new` to create a new Poetry project. But as we want to use `ansible-galaxy` to create a new Ansible collection and role, we'll leverage the `poetry init` command. This will only create a `pyproject.toml` file in an interactive fashion:

```
$ poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

Package name [molecule-ansible-poetry]:  
Version [0.1.0]:

python = "^3.11"


[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"


Do you confirm generation? (yes/no) [yes] yes

```

The `pyproject.toml` is where everything Poetry related comes together - especially Python dependencies for our Ansible collection/roles.


## Add Ansible & Molecule via Poetry

Now we can [issue our Molecule installation](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/installation/) leverageing Poetry via `poetry add ansible-core molecule`:

```
$ poetry add ansible-core molecule
Creating virtualenv molecule-ansible-poetry-MP2KKXLA-py3.11 in /home/jonashackt/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs

Writing lock file
```

The new dependecy `molecule` should appear inside the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

If we only use the Delegated driver, that's it for now.

If we want to use other drivers, we need to install them separately by using `poetry add "molecule-plugins[docker]"`.

> Molecule uses the \"delegated\" driver by default. Other drivers can be installed separately from PyPI, most of them being included in molecule-plugins package: https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins

```
$ poetry add "molecule-plugins[docker]"
```


## Create Ansible collection & role via ansible-galaxy

But running `ansible` or other commands doesn't seem to work right now. Why is that?

In order to be able to use the installed packages, we need to spin up a Python virtual environment. That's handled by Poetry for us and we only need to run:

```
poetry shell
```

Now our executable should be available. Just try to run `ansible` or `ansible-galaxy`. They should work now as expected!

The [crucial point here](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/getting-started/) is this:

> One of the recommended ways to create a collection is to place it under a `collections/ansible_collections` directory. If you don't put your collection into a directory named `ansible_collections`, molecule won't be able to find your role.

If we don't create the directory accordingly, we'll run into errors like this later:

```shell
TASK [Testing role install_python_pip] *****************************************
ERROR! the role 'jonashackt.moleculetest.install_python_pip' was not found in /home/jonashackt/dev/molecule-ansible-poetry/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/roles:/home/jonashackt/dev/molecule-ansible-poetry/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/roles:/home/jonashackt/dev/molecule-ansible-poetry/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default

The error appears to be in '/home/jonashackt/dev/molecule-ansible-poetry/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/converge.yml': line 10, column 15, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: jonashackt.moleculetest.install_python_pip
              ^ here

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
```

So __BEFORE__ proceeding any further, we need to create a directory `collections/ansible_collections` ([`mkdir -p` will help to create the subdirectory from one command](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1731775/4964553)):

```shell
$ mkdir -p collections/ansible_collections
```

We have everything to create our first Ansible collection via `ansible-galaxy collection init my.collection.name`. Just be sure to `cd` into the `collections/ansible_collections` dir before:

```shell
$ cd collections/ansible_collections
$ ansible-galaxy collection init jonashackt.moleculetest
```

After this we can cd into `roles` dir of our newly created collection and create a new Ansible role inside via `ansible-galaxy role init`

```shell
$ cd jonashackt/moleculetest/roles
$ ansible-galaxy role init install_python_pip
```


## Add Molecule to the collection & run first test cycle

Now we can finally add Molecule to the game.

Therefore create a new directory `extensions` in the root of the collection:

```shell
$ mkdir extensions && cd extensions
```

Inside the `extensions` directory we can now create our Molecule scenario using `molecule init scenario`:

```shell
$ molecule init scenario
INFO     Initializing new scenario default...

PLAY [Create a new molecule scenario] ******************************************

INFO     Initialized scenario in /home/jonashackt/dev/molecule-ansible-poetry/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default successfully.
```

[The docs](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/getting-started/#molecule-scenarios) have a great starting point what Molecule scenarios are:

> Scenarios are the starting point for a lot of powerful functionality that Molecule offers. For now, we can think of a scenario as a test suite for roles or playbooks within a collection. You can have as many scenarios as you like and Molecule will run one after the other.

Another way of thinking about the created playbooks `create.yml`, `converge.yml`, `molecule.yml` & `destroy.yml` is to use the analogy of the BDD-style inspired way of structuring tests using `Given`, `When`, `Then`. See also this blog post for more info https://www.codecentric.de/wissens-hub/blog/test-driven-infrastructure-ansible-molecule 

In order to tell Molecule that it should execute and test our previously generated role, we need to change the [converge.yml](jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/converge.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Testing role install_python_pip
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: jonashackt.moleculetest.install_python_pip
        tasks_from: main.yml
```

Now we are already able to run a full Molecule test cycle via `molecule test`:

> It can be particularly useful to pass the `--destroy=never` flag when invoking molecule test so that you can tell Molecule to run the full sequence but not destroy the instance if one step fails.

```shell
$ molecule test
```


## Create local Molecule instance using Docker (via Delegated)

A great idea is to leverage containers for Molecule tests. In contrast to earlier Molecule versions, [Delegated is the default driver](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/#driver) and it's the developers responsibility to implement it:

> Under this driver, it is the developers responsibility to implement the create and destroy playbooks.

To use Docker as a test instance in Molecule, we need to create a `requirements.yml` to hold the [community.docker](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker/index.html) collection:

```yaml
collections:
  - community.docker
```

In order to have Molecule/Ansible recognize this dependency, we need to define it inside our [molecule.yml](collections/ansible_collections/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/molecule.yml):

```yaml
dependency:
  name: galaxy
  options:
    requirements-file: requirements.yml

platforms:
  - name: molecule-ubuntu
    image: ubuntu:23.04
```

Also we defined a Docker image to use inside the `platforms` section.

Now heading over to our [create.yml](collections/ansible_collections/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/create.yml) can create a Docker container instance (see also https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/docker/):

```yaml
---
- name: Create
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    molecule_inventory:
      all:
        hosts: {}
        molecule: {}
  tasks:
    - name: Create a container
      community.docker.docker_container:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        image: "{{ item.image }}"
        state: started
        command: sleep 1d
        log_driver: json-file
      register: container_result
      loop: "{{ molecule_yml.platforms }}"

    - name: Print some info
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ container_result.results }}"

    - name: Add container to molecule_inventory
      vars:
        inventory_partial_yaml: |
          all:
            children:
              molecule:
                hosts:
                  "{{ item.name }}":
                    ansible_connection: community.docker.docker
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        molecule_inventory: >
          {{ molecule_inventory | combine(inventory_partial_yaml | from_yaml, recursive=true) }}
      loop: "{{ molecule_yml.platforms }}"
      loop_control:
        label: "{{ item.name }}" # display the container name only https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_loops.html#limiting-loop-output-with-label

    - name: Dump molecule_inventory
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: |
          {{ molecule_inventory | to_yaml }}
        dest: "{{ molecule_ephemeral_directory }}/inventory/molecule_inventory.yml"
        mode: "0600"

    - name: Refresh inventory to ensure new instances exist in inventory
      ansible.builtin.meta: refresh_inventory

    - name: Fail if molecule group is missing
      ansible.builtin.assert:
        that: "'molecule' in groups"
        fail_msg: |
          molecule group was not found inside inventory groups: {{ groups }}
      run_once: true # noqa: run-once[task]

# we want to avoid errors like "Failed to create temporary directory"
- name: Validate that inventory was refreshed
  hosts: molecule
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Check uname
      ansible.builtin.raw: uname -a
      register: check_uname_result
      changed_when: false

    - name: Display uname info
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ check_uname_result.stdout }}"
```

We can try to create our first Molecule instance via:

```shell
molecule create
```

If you get the following error:

```shell
TASK [Create a container] ******************************************************
An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
failed: [localhost] (item={'image': 'ubuntu:23.04', 'name': 'molecule-ubuntu'}) => {"ansible_loop_var": "item", "changed": false, "item": {"image": "ubuntu:23.04", "name": "molecule-ubuntu"}, "msg": "Failed to import the required Python library (requests) on pikelinux's Python /home/jonashackt/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/molecule-ansible-poetry-MP2KKXLA-py3.11/bin/python.

If the required library is installed, but Ansible is using the wrong Python interpreter, please consult the documentation on ansible_python_interpreter"}
```

we need to add the Python package `requests` to our [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) via `poetry add requests`.

If everything went fine, we should have a container running:

You may have a look with `docker ps`, if the container is really running:

```shell
$ docker ps          
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                       NAMES

```

We also need to implement our [destroy.yml](collections/ansible_collections/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/destroy.yml):

```yaml
- name: Destroy molecule containers
  hosts: molecule
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Stop and remove container
      delegate_to: localhost
      community.docker.docker_container:
        name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        state: absent
        auto_remove: true

- name: Remove dynamic molecule inventory
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Remove dynamic inventory file
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "{{ molecule_ephemeral_directory }}/inventory/molecule_inventory.yml"
        state: absent
```

Running `molecule destroy` our Docker container should be removed. You can double check, if it got destroyed via `docker ps`.


## Run Molecule converge to our Docker container test instance

First we should enhance our [converge.yml](collections/ansible_collections/jonashackt/moleculetest/extensions/molecule/default/converge.yml) as it is stated in https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/docker/#converge-playbook to fail if molecule group is missing.

```yaml
---
- name: Fail if molecule group is missing
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Print some info
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ groups }}"

    - name: Assert group existence
      ansible.builtin.assert:
        that: "'molecule' in groups"
        fail_msg: |
          molecule group was not found inside inventory groups: {{ groups }}

- name: Converge
  hosts: molecule
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Testing role install_python_pip
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: jonashackt.moleculetest.install_python_pip
        tasks_from: main.yml
```

Also our `Converge` playbook should point to the `molecule` host, which represents our Docker container.

As we only have some debug printing inside our Ansible role under test right now, we should also enhance it inside [roles/install_python_pip/tasks/main.yml](collections/ansible_collections/jonashackt/moleculetest/roles/install_python_pip/tasks/main.yml):

```yaml
---
# tasks file for install_python_pip
- name: In order to get Ansible working, we need to install Python first (the snake bites itself)
  ansible.builtin.raw: apt update && apt install python3 -y

- name: Check Python was installed successfully
  ansible.builtin.raw: python3 --version
  register: python_result

- name: Print Python version installed
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "{{ python_result.stdout }}"

- name: Let's install the Python package manager pip
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    pkg:
      - python3-pip
    update_cache: yes
```

As we use a "naked" base image like ubuntu, we don't have python installed. So we need to install it before we can actually use our Ansible modules like `ansible.builtin.apt` as we're used to.
